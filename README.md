Image Pipe
==========

Pipeline building solution for 4D biological microscopy

Description:
------------

This project is still in development. Initially started as a tool for
Ruan, Zhou et al, Nature 2017, this pipeline has since grown to allow
arbitrary pipeline construction based on a set of primitive functions
and abstractions (pipe, tiling, per-segment processing, etc...).

This project is currently in alpha development, hence poorly documented,
sparsely tested and prone to rapid changes.
