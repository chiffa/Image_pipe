Image Pipe
==========

Pipeline building solution for 4D biological microscopy

Description:
------------

This project is still in development. Initially started as a tool for
Ruan, Zhou et al, Nature 2017, this pipeline has since grown to allow
arbitrary pipeline construction based on a set of primitive functions
and abstractions (pipe, tiling, per-segment processing, etc...).

This project is currently in alpha development, hence poorly documented,
sparsely tested and prone to rapid changes.

Basic installation:

    > pip install imagepipe

or:

    > pip install git+https://github.com/chiffa/Image_pipe.git

The documentation is available [on
readthedocs](https://image-pipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Project is housed at [GitHub](https://github.com/chiffa/Image_pipe). For
any issues please refer to GitHub issue tracker.
